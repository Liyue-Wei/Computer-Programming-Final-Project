/*
Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable.
Pointers are used to access the memory location of a variable.

The address of a variable can be obtained by preceding the name of the variable with an ampersand sign (&), known as the address-of operator.
The value of a variable can be obtained by preceding the pointer with an asterisk sign (*), known as the dereference operator.

data_type *pointer_name;    // pointer declaration
data_type *pointer_name = &variable_name;    // pointer initialization
    
declare a pointer to an data_type variable  -->  data_type *pointer_name = &variable_name;    // e.g. int *ptr = &num;
